109.4 Configure Client-Side DNS
THE BASICS OF DNS RESOLUTION FROM LINUX
----- /etc/hosts - it contain the localhost entry mapped to the lookback address.
----- /etc/hostname - system will use this file for a computer's hostname . the hostnamectl fill will write a system's new hostname to this file.
----- /etc/resolve.conf - this file contains the ip address of DNS name serves that the host will use for name resolution.
----- /etc/nsswitch.conf - file is used to determine the order in which name resolution occurs.
----- host (name) - command used to resolve domain names to ip address.
----- dig (name) - command is used to query DNS server for particular types of DNS records.
----- dig -t MX google.com (example)

FILESYSTEM AND DEVICES
----- mount - mount a filesystem 

----- fuser - identify processes using files or sockets(fuser displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or  file systems.   In the default display mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:
	       c      current directory.
              e      executable being run.
              f      open file.  f is omitted in default display mode.
              F      open file for writing.  F is omitted in  default  display
                     mode.
              r      root directory.
              m      mmap'ed file or shared library.
              .      Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.

----- fdisk -l
----- mount -t ext3 /dev/xvdj1 /mnt/data - to mount (ext4 is the file system type. (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro) is the mount options.
----- mount -o remoute,rw /mnt/data 
----- umount /mnt/data
----- mount -a - show all

e2label - Change the label on an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem

sync - Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage (If one or more files are specified, sync only them, or their containing file systems).
swapon - swapon, swapoff - enable/disable devices and files for paging and swap‚Äêping (swapon is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping  are  to take place)
----- swapoff -a (all)
----- swapon -s (summary)

mkfs - build a Linux filesystem (This  mkfs  frontend  is  deprecated  in  favour of filesystem specific mkfs.<type> utils).
----- which mkfs - to find/know location
----- ls -al /sbin/mkfs*
----- which fsck
----- ls -al /sbin/fsc*

dumpe2fs - dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem information(dumpe2fs prints the super block and blocks group  information  for  the filesystem present on device).

tune2fs  -  adjust  tunable  filesystem  parameters  on  ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems(tune2fs allows the  system  administrator  to  adjust  various  tunable filesystem  parameters  on  Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems.  The current values of these options can be displayed by using the -l optionto tune2fs(8) program, or by using the dumpe2fs(8) program.
----- man tune2fs

debugfs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system debugger (The debugfs program is an interactive file system debugger. It  can  be used  to  examine  and  change the state of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system).

----- sudo apt-get install xfsprogs
----- xfsrestore -I (show all backup details)

ZFS - is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager
btrfs - is used to perform several whole filesystem level tasks, including all the regular filesystem operations like resizing, space stats, label setting/getting, and defragmentation. There are other whole filesystem tasks like scrub or balance that are grouped in separate commands.
----- swapon -a
----- swapon -s show a particular file location on partition 
----- 82 - swapon
----- 83 - simple  memory
----- mkswap - create swapspace
----- sudo apt-get install cryptsetup
